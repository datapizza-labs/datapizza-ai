        Initialize the FileSystem. You can set `paths_to_include` and `paths_to_exclude` as glob or regex patterns on file names to reduce the scope of the tool.
        By default, all paths are included. Exclusion patterns are evaluated after the inclusion patterns, Therefore, exclusion patterns should apply subfilters on the inclusion patterns to be effective.
        Example usage::

                        FileSystem() #includes the whole file system
                        FileSystem(paths_to_include=["/project/dir/*"]) # includes all the files in /project/dir/
                        FileSystem(paths_to_exclude=["/project/dir/.env"], paths_to_include=["/project/dir/*"]) # includes all the files in /project/dir/ except .env
                        FileSystem(paths_to_exclude=["*/.env"], paths_to_include=["/project/dir/*"]) # as above, includes all the files in /project/dir/ except .env
                        FileSystem(paths_to_exclude=["/data/archive.zip"], paths_to_include=["*.zip", "*.txt"]) #includes all txt and zip files except /data/archive.zip
